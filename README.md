# CNN Homework Assignment

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for [specific task]. The project demonstrates fundamental CNN concepts and includes data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation.

## Contents

- `hw2_cnn.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the complete implementation.
- Data files (if applicable): Placeholder for datasets used in the project.
- `README.md`: Documentation for understanding and using the repository.

## Project Overview

This project involves building and training a Convolutional Neural Network to solve [specific problem, e.g., image classification, object detection, etc.]. The implementation emphasizes the following:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles input data preparation, normalization, and augmentation techniques.
- **Model Architecture**: Uses layers like convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers to extract and learn spatial features.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Incorporates metrics like accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices to monitor performance.

### Key Features of the Model

1. **Input Layer**: Accepts images of size `[size]` and normalizes pixel values to [normalization range].
2. **Convolution Layers**: Uses [number] convolutional layers with filter sizes `[size]` and activation functions such as ReLU to capture local features.
3. **Pooling Layers**: Employs max pooling for down-sampling while retaining key information.
4. **Fully Connected Layers**: Flattens the feature map and passes it through dense layers for prediction.
5. **Output Layer**: Outputs a [softmax/sigmoid] probability distribution for [classification, regression] tasks.

### Training Process

- **Loss Function**: [Specify loss function, e.g., categorical cross-entropy].
- **Optimizer**: [Specify optimizer, e.g., Adam, SGD].
- **Metrics**: Evaluates model accuracy, precision, recall, etc., depending on the task.
